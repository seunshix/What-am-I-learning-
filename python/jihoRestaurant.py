Play around and have fun with our new knowledge of function arguments. 
Here is some additional functionality that Jiho might like:

1. The ability to remove a tableâ€™s guests when they leave the restaurant.
2. An adjustment to the calculate_price_per_person() function to access a 
tables 'total' and return the result.
3. The ability to add and remove order items for both food and drinks if there is ever a mistake.
4.The ability to queue reservations for later times for specific tables.
